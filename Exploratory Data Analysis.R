#Principles of exploratory data analysis
# 1.Show evidence , compared to what , show comparisons 
# Evidence for a hypothesis is always relative to another competing theory

# 2.Show causality, mechanism, explanation, systematic structure
# What is the causal framework for thinking about a question

# 3. Show multivariate data
# Multivariate = more than 2 variables
# Need to escape flat land

# 4.Integration of evidence
 # Completely integrate words, numbers , image , diagrams
 # Data graphics should make use of many modes of data presentation
 # Don't let the tool drive the analysis

#5 Describe and document the evidence with appropriate labels, scales , sources etc
